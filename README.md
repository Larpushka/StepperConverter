Stepper movement to video games converter

This script is for an arduino DIY project: converting movement from a home-made stepper (step machine) to game movement. See the instructables here:

It will work for any game that receives ("w") as forward movement. It can work for VR games as well if they accept keyboard input. It probably won't work for console games (haven't tested it).
